   - **1 hour** - Occasional reminders
4. Tap **Add**

## How Notifications Work

### When Do I Get Notified?
- Notifications start immediately after adding a task
- They repeat at your chosen interval
- Example: If you choose "5 minutes", you'll get notified every 5 minutes

### What Do Notifications Look Like?
```
🔔 Nag Reminder
Don't forget: Buy groceries
```

### Important Notes
- Notifications continue even when the app is closed
- They keep coming until you mark the task complete
- You can receive notifications even if your phone is locked
- The app badge shows you have pending reminders

## Tips for Best Results

### Choosing Reminder Intervals
- **Short intervals (1-5 min)**: Tasks you need to do RIGHT NOW
- **Medium intervals (10-15 min)**: Important tasks for today
- **Long intervals (30-60 min)**: Tasks you need to remember but aren't urgent

### Staying Organized
- Complete tasks as soon as you finish them
- Delete tasks that are no longer relevant
- The app separates pending and completed tasks automatically

### Managing Notifications
- Keep the app's notification permission enabled
- Check your iPhone's notification settings if you're not receiving alerts
- Make sure "Do Not Disturb" isn't blocking notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving Notifications?
1. Check: Settings → Notifications → Nag
2. Ensure "Allow Notifications" is ON
3. Check that "Do Not Disturb" is OFF
4. Restart the app

### Timer Not Updating?
- The countdown updates every second when viewing the task list
- Close and reopen the app if it seems stuck

### App Not Saving Tasks?
- Tasks are saved automatically when you add them
- They persist across app restarts
- No internet connection required

## Privacy & Data

- **All data stays on your device**
- No account required
- No data sent to servers
- Delete the app to remove all data

## Advanced Usage

### Multiple Tasks
- Add as many tasks as you need
- Each task has its own independent timer
- You can have different reminder intervals for each task

### Managing Many Notifications
- iOS limits how many notifications can be pending
- Consider varying your intervals to spread out reminders
- Complete or delete tasks you no longer need

### Best Practices
1. Start with longer intervals and shorten if needed
2. Don't add tasks you won't actually do
3. Complete tasks promptly to reduce notification fatigue
4. Review and clean up your list regularly

## Need Help?

If you're experiencing issues:
1. Make sure you're running iOS 16.0 or later
2. Try restarting the app
3. Check notification permissions
4. Reinstall the app if problems persist

Remember: Nag is designed to be persistent and a little annoying - that's the point! It helps ensure you actually complete your tasks.
